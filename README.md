# Web-Safe-Font-Preview

##Tech used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery

This page allows the user to preview different font families, font sizes and font weights in various combinations before using them on a website.

If I were to do this project again, I would change the color scheme, make the input boxes bigger and have a larger collection of font families to chose from.
